Arduino Snake
=============
 (8x8 pixel arcade machine!)

This project is based on an machine programming assingment to make a snake game on a LED display at Högskolan i Skövde.

The project consists of several programs, 3 games as well as a couple of testing programs. To select program, the user cycles through a menu of animated icons representing the different programs by moving the joystick left and right and selects a program by moving the joystick up or down.

The programs that currently exist are:
* Snake
* Tetris
* Asteroids
* Timer Visualizer
* RNG Visualizer
* Joystick Visualizer
* Error Icon Loop (If an error is caught, the program terminates to an error screen. This is a loop that displays the different error icons that exist)
* Blank screen
* Exit (Normal termination occurs after returning from a program)

The hardware consists of an Arduino Uno board with an Atmega328P processor and a LedJoy LED display and joystick unit connected to it.
